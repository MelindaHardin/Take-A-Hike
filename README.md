This project was developed by a project team consisting of four students actively engaged in a coding bootcamp from an accredited university.

This project gave the project team experience working with current web technologies such as: JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML GeoLocation API, Google Firebase, Google Fonts, CoverVid.js and several third party APIs.

This project also gave team members useful experience working with deployments to GitHub from shared components.

Project team members also gained valuable design and project management experience by working as a team to deliver a product that met all design requirements within the due date.

Currently, only the project team members maintain and contribute to this project.
